This is a front-end project for a website in Figma, I developed it with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. In the future, I will add the back-end

The link for the Figma design : https://www.figma.com/design/uqoBVHdH3tggHMmpvCRWoZ/StartupYar_Webpage_Revamp--Community-?node-id=0-1&t=lh5dhROCDxVkAud3-1

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
